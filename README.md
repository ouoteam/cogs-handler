## Support
Implementing this into your bot requires you to have a basic knowledge of Python and Py-cord, and it will not work if you only copy the code into your bot. However, for support, join [our Discord server](https://discord.com/servers/ouo-community-970310299603312701). Please note that we will not provide you a tutorial of implementation.
